    "# Bear4 Tutorial - Large Language Model Prompt Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will embark on a mission to extract a hidden bear name from a Large Language Model (LLM). Despite the model being explicitly programmed to withhold this name, your task is to employ prompt hacking techniques ingeniously to coax the model into divulging it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your main goal is to prompt the LLM in such a way that it inadvertently reveals the bear name. The backend system is designed to automatically recognize if it has revealed the bear name to you. If it does the response JSON will include a `flag` key with the flag value in it- so keep an eye out for the `flag` in the JSON response.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial - Prompt Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will equip you with knowledge on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the foundational setup of Large Language Models (LLMs) to resist responding to certain prohibited queries.\n",
    "2. Exploring techniques used to obfuscate and manipulate these models.\n",
    "3. Applying these techniques against a real LLM to test their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt injection** is a cunning technique devised to circumvent model defenses by embedding or altering prompts in a way that induces the model to respond with otherwise restricted information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To grasp the concept of LLM evasion, it's essential to comprehend how LLMs are fortified against such attacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs undergo two primary training phases:\n",
    "  1. **Pre-training:** This initial stage involves training the model on vast quantities of text data from the internet. While this data may contain non-politically correct (non-PC) information, the primary goal is to develop the model's understanding of word relationships and language structure.\n",
    "  2. **Fine-tuning:** In this critical phase, models are trained on a smaller set of high-quality text. It's during fine-tuning that the model acquires its distinct \"tone\" or \"voice.\" This stage also involves adjusting the model to avoid mentioning controversial information and to ensure responses are ethically aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To defend against jailbreaking attempts, models utilize several strategies:\n",
    "  1. **Preprompt Instructions:** These are directives provided to the model before processing any user requests, guiding it on how to handle or avoid certain topics.\n",
    "  2. **Prompt Filtering:** Mechanisms are implemented to reject queries that contain specific keywords or patterns deemed inappropriate or off-limits.\n",
    "  3. **Post-response Filtering:** Similar to prompt filtering, this technique screens out responses containing forbidden words or phrases, ensuring that the model's outputs adhere to predefined ethical standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This overview only scratches the surface of LLM defenses. As an offensive security professional, pinpointing vulnerabilities in these defenses is crucial for developing innovative evasion techniques and, consequently, enhancing defensive strategies.\n"
